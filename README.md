# shirtigo
A repo for the shirtigo test

## Important Notes
1. `Inertia` is used for internal connection between front-end & back-end. Axios was also a possiblity.
2. `Vue 3` is used for frontend.
3. `mysql` was used only for the basic migrations, `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, `SESSION_DRIVER` & `CACHE_STORE`. You can change `.env.example` based on your own settings.
4. `TypeScript` is not used but it would've been possible.
5. This repo is not in production mode for your easier checkings (DEBUGGING is enabled).
